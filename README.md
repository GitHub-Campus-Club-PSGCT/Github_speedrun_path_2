# GitHub Speedrun Challenge

Welcome to the **GitHub Speedrun Challenge**! Your goal is to navigate through a series of folders to reach the **destination file** by solving clues and identifying the correct paths. Follow the instructions below carefully to complete the challenge.

## Instructions

1. **General Path**: You’ll be given a general path to follow. It uses common nouns as a guide to the folder sequence. For example:
   - **music_director/states/sports/fruits/School_accessories/Body_parts/Home_appliance/animals**

2. **Folder Structure**:
   - Each folder in the repository is named after specific nouns from the general path, but the names are **incomplete or jumbled** (e.g., `T_M_LN_DU` for *TAMIL NADU*).
   - Follow the general path sequence, going from one category to the next (e.g., **music_director → states → sports**, etc.).

3. **Finding the Correct Path**:
   - Identify the correct words for each folder name and navigate through them in order.
   - If you select the correct noun (e.g., the correct music director or state), you’ll receive a **hint** in the folder to help guide your next steps.
   - Sometimes, there will be multiple choices for a category (e.g., different states or music directors). Only the correct choice will guide you further.

4. **Dead Ends**:
   - Choosing an incorrect folder at any point may lead you to a **plain.txt** file or subfolders that eventually lead to **plain.txt**.
   - **plain.txt** indicates a dead end. If you reach it, you must restart from the beginning, so choose carefully!

5. **Winning**:
   - The **destination file** lies at the end of the correct path. When you reach it, take note of the final sequence you navigated through.
   - Rewrite the **general path** using the complete words in the order you discovered them to show your solution.

## General Path 2
> **tamil flims/tamil cartoons/tamil music directors/tamil songs/ tamil directors/hollywood directors/wild animals/tamil actress**

This is the path structure you should aim to follow. Decipher the folder names, avoid dead ends, and find the destination!

Good luck, and enjoy the challenge!
